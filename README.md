# Fund-Me-Remix
Smart contract that lets people deposit ETH and allow owner to withdraw ETH

In this contract we learn about:

1. Payable functions.
2. Getting external data (price feeds; ETH->USD) from decentralized oracles such as chainlink.
3. Receiving funds and storing the list of senders.
4. Setting owner of the contract.
5. Withdrawing funds (only by smart contract owner).
6. Setting permissions
7. Working with real blockchains and oracles (Kovan testnet in our case).
